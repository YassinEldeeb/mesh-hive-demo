# GraphQL Mesh <> Hive Demo

In this demo, you'll learn how to integrate [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh) with [Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive). We'll show you how to set up a local supergraph, connect it to Hive for supergraph polling, usage reporting, and schema management. You'll also see how to use key plugins in GraphQL Mesh, like response caching and rate limiting. By following this guide, you'll be able to set up and run your own GraphQL Mesh instance with Hive, making your GraphQL API management easier.


#### 1. Create a Hive Account and Project
First, sign up for a Hive account if you haven't already. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.graphql-hive.com/first-steps) to create your account, install Hive CLI, and create a new Hive project. For this demo, choose the "Apollo Federation" project type.


#### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yassineldeeb/graphql-mesh-hive-demo
```
